During our recent investigation into these types of systems, we discovered a simple but remarkably effective algorithm for converting a large corpus of tags annotating objects in a tagging system into a navigable hierarchical taxonomy of tags.  We first discuss the algorithm and then present a preliminary model to explain why it is so effective in these types of systems.}

	abstract = {Many applications could benefit from labeled metadata of the sort which collaborative tagging systems produce. I looked at the data produced by one of these systems, the social bookmarking system del.icio.us, to determine whether or not the tags produced by these systems are useful externally to other applications as opposed to internally as a means of navigation. I found that due to a variety of factors, the tagging data created by users tends to be much less well distributed and has much more easily predictable information than systems like those of Luis von Ahn which are specifically engineered for the purpose of leveraging users to create metadata. However, I also found that the subjective, intrinsic information that users create may be more valuable than objective, extrinsic information that they might be forced to create because of its difficulty of prediction.

During our recent investigation into these types of systems, we discovered a simple but remarkably effective algorithm for converting a large corpus of tags annotating objects in a tagging system into a navigable hierarchical taxonomy of tags.  We first discuss the algorithm and then present a preliminary model to explain why it is so effective in these types of systems.}

The materials must be tailored and contextualized to promote the instructional goals. To provide this contextualization, we have applied the concept of a guided path, an ordered list of pages independent of the existing Web structure. Besides creating the structure, a teacher may annotate the individual pages of a path to provide transition, emphasis, and missing explanation. In addition, some limited interactivity and control over the display of remote information is possible in our prototype path server. This prototype, called Walden&apos;s Paths, works with existing Web browsers and servers allowing its integration into an educational setting with existing hardware and software.
